	abstract = {This concise, accessible text provides a thorough introduction to quantum computing - an exciting emergent field at the interface of the computer, engineering, mathematical and physical sciences.  Aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in these disciplines, the text is technically detailed and is clearly illustrated throughout with diagrams and exercises.  Some prior knowledge of linear algebra is assumed, including vector spaces and inner products.  However, prior familiarity with topics such as tensor products and spectral decomposition is not required, as the necessary material is reviewed in the text.},
